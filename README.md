This work is an in-depth fully Bayesian analysis on data that are the result of a NIST study involving circular interference transmittance. The response variable Yi is transmittance (in [0,1]), and the predictor variable xi is wavelength (cm, in R+); there are N=35 observations. We decided to consider a non linear regression model:

The complete analysis is in the repository. It is an .html file so you need a reader to read it.
